# Something about me

{% include test.html %}

[about me section]

This is a collection of my works that I'd like to share with you.

This website is also part of my portfolio, which I built on GitHub Pages based on Jekyll. It is **static**, **responsive**, **markdown-based** and **light-weight**.

I structured this site with HTML and styled it with CSS, with a pinch of JavaScript. It can be maintained quickly and easily – managing contents is so simple that I only need a text editor, any text editor, because of markdown.
